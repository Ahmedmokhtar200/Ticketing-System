# Ticketing System

## Overview

This ticketing system is designed to streamline the process of handling various types of tickets within big tech companies. Employees can submit tickets for problems, questions, or requests, each categorized according to predefined categories specified in an external file.

## Features

- **Ticket Submission**: Employees can submit tickets mentioning their name, the type of ticket (problem, question, or request), and the category of the ticket.
- **Category Management**: Ticket categories are defined outside the program in an external file (`ticketcategories.txt`).

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- Prepare a file named `ticketcategories.txt` containing the list of ticket categories.

## Example Ticket Submission
When an employee submits a ticket, they will provide the following information:

Name: Employee's name.
Type of Ticket: The type of ticket (problem, question, or request).
Category: The category of the ticket (as defined in ticketcategories.txt).

Thank you for using our ticketing system! We hope it helps streamline your ticket management process.
